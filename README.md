## Description of the app
This is an Angular 8 project for practising various functionalities and patterns implemented in the framework. The app is not visually pleasing but that is not the point of it. This is a recipe app where a user needs to authenticate via e-mail and password. He or she can create new recipes with ingredients, description and a photo. A list of the recipes is presented in the main view of the app. Any of the fields can be edited. 

## Environment variables!!!
The folder environments.example needs to be renamed to environments.
In the folder there are 2 files: enviornment.example.ts and enviornment.example.ts
The fields "firebaseAPIKey" and "firebaseDBURL" should be filled with your credentials in order to make the app work. These credentials can be received after creating a Firebase account.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
